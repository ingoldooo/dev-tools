A collection of development tools I use wherever I go that save me a ton of valuable time:

* A collection of bash infra tools
* Git repo lifecycle with nested submodules handling
* Build - Install - Deploy android apps from terminal (I am not the biggest fan of launching via Studio)
* CI bash tools for project and version

* Gradle build and deploy utility scripts

* My personal Intellij formatter and settings
